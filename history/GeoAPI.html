    <h1>GeoAPI history</h1>
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.geoapi.org/">GeoAPI</a> is a standard from the Open Geospatial Consortium (<abbr>OGC</abbr>)
      defining Java interfaces in the <code>org.opengis</code> namespace.
      This namespace is used for Java module names and package names.
      This name must be unique for making interoperability possible,
      or for allowing projects coexistence in the same <abbr title="Java Virtual Machine">JVM</abbr>.
    </p>

    <h2>First apparition of GeoAPI interfaces</h2>
    <p>
      Talks at <abbr>OGC</abbr> about standard Java interfaces
      go as far as <a href="https://portal.ogc.org/files/?artifact_id=3578">February 2000</a>.
      The first public release of Java interfaces in <code>org.opengis</code> packages was in the
      <a href="https://www.ogc.org/standard/ct/">OpenGIS Coordinate Transformation Service Implementation Specification</a>
      (<abbr>OGC</abbr> 01-009) standard, published in January 12th, 2001.
      That specification was edited by Computer Aided Development Corporation (Cadcorp) Ltd.
      The Java sources and
       <abbr title="Interface Description Language">IDL</abbr> files
      (<abbr title="Component Object Model">COM</abbr> and
       <abbr title="Common Object Request Broker Architecture">CORBA</abbr>)
      were attached to the specification in a <abbr>ZIP</abbr> file.
      While the <abbr>ZIP</abbr> file is no longer available on the
      <abbr title="Open Geospatial Consortium">OGC</abbr> download page,
      the Java source files are still mentioned in many sections of the specification:
      §2 (overview),
      §3.3 (object mutability),
      §3.4 (error handling),
      §6.3 (Java profile),
      §12 (UML representation),
      §13.3 (Java) and
      §14.1 (guidelines for development of conformance test).
      Section §6.3 starts with the following introduction:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      The Java profile is specified in the attached Java source files.
      Each Java package is called “<code>org.opengis.<var>xx</var></code>”
      where “<var>xx</var>” is the two-character package prefix in lower case.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Section §13.3 is as below:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      As there are so many Java files (one for each interface as opposed to one for each package),
      the Java listings have not been included here. Please see the attached Java source files and
      JavaDoc HTML documentation.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      At the time when <abbr>OGC</abbr> 01-009 was published,
      <abbr>OGC</abbr> was named <cite>The OpenGIS® consortium</cite>
      and its web site was hosted at <a href="http://www.opengis.org">http://www.opengis.org</a>.
      Consequently the use of <code>org.opengis</code> package name was a natural choice.
      Still today, the Open Geospatial Consortium owns the <u>opengis.org</u> domain name
      and OpenGIS is still a <a href="https://www.ogc.org/about/policies/media-guidance/">registered
      <abbr title="Open Geospatial Consortium">OGC</abbr> trademark</a>.
      The GeoAPI name however was not yet in use.
    </p>

    <h2>Early implementation</h2>
    <p>
      The <a href="https://seagis.sourceforge.net/">Seagis project</a> started to implement
      the <abbr>OGC</abbr> 01-009 specification in
      <a href="https://github.com/desruisseaux/Seagis/commit/623ef7660e3e6972432519b45011a1ab78eb36e7">August 2001</a>,
      at first under its own package name for avoiding name conflicts,
      <a href="https://github.com/desruisseaux/Seagis/commit/141d65fe90ee9a42e90ed60f240938cc43213178">later</a>
      as an implementation of interfaces published by <abbr>OGC</abbr>.
      After ten months of development, Seagis code has been
      <a href="https://github.com/desruisseaux/Seagis/commit/6757ff50f8d79d159aa9394ad412d0a75a8cd162">donated to GeoTools 2</a>
      and became the GeoTools metadata, referencing and coverage core (excluding I/O) modules.
      This donation brought to GeoTools its connection to <code>org.opengis</code> interfaces.
    </p>

    <h2>Formation of GeoAPI open source project</h2>
    <p>
      In September 2002, a <a href="https://portal.ogc.org/files/?artifact_id=103494">joint presentation
      about Grid Coverages in Java</a> was done at the OGC meeting in Noordwijk by Markus Müller (Degree, now lat/lon GmbH)
      and Martin Desruisseaux (<abbr title="Institut de Recherche pour le Développement">IRD</abbr>).
      It was followed by an informal discussion between above-cited speakers and
      James McGill (Geotools), Stephane Fellah (PCI Geomatic),
      an <abbr title="University Corporation for Atmospheric Research">UCAR</abbr> reprensentative
      and an <abbr title="Open Geospatial Consortium">OGC</abbr> representative
      (<i>source:</i> travel report to <abbr title="Institut de Recherche pour le Développement">IRD</abbr>).
      Following that discussion, James McGill launched in October 2002 a
      <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030509104308/http://digitalearth.org/story/2002/10/10/55046/206">call
      for the creation of a geospatial <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr></a>.
      The initial proposal attracted the interest of at least five open source projects.
      The project was created using a <abbr title="Concurrent Versions System">CVS</abbr> repository
      on <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/geoapi/">SourceForge</a>
      (now migrated on <a href="https://github.com/opengeospatial/geoapi">GitHub</a>).
      It was then that the project assumed the name “GeoAPI”.
      The <a href="https://github.com/opengeospatial/geoapi/commit/b72d3bc3922d306e60ae83f571b15adea92edbf4">first commit</a>
      was in December 24, 2002, nearly two years after <abbr title="Open Geospatial Consortium">OGC</abbr> 01-009 publication.
    </p><p>
      In 2003, the <abbr title="Open Geospatial Consortium">OGC</abbr>
      <abbr title="Coordinate Reference System">CRS</abbr> working group started to
      <a href="https://portal.ogc.org/files/?artifact_id=4720">transition from OGC 01-009 to ISO-19111.</a>
      During the Orléan <abbr title="Open Geospatial Consortium">OGC</abbr> meeting in April 2003,
      an informal discussion happened between Markus Müller (Degree), Ian Turton (GeoTools),
      Martin Daly (editor of <abbr title="Open Geospatial Consortium">OGC</abbr> 01-009) and
      Martin Desruisseaux (<abbr title="Institut de Recherche pour le Développement">IRD</abbr>).
      It was agreed that the Java interfaces published by <abbr title="Open Geospatial Consortium">OGC</abbr> 01-009
      were not longer conform to latest <abbr title="Unified Modeling Language">UML</abbr> diagrams
      and that the creation of new Java interfaces will be mandated to the GeoAPI project
      (<i>source:</i> travel report to <abbr title="Institut de Recherche pour le Développement">IRD</abbr>).
      The <a href="https://github.com/opengeospatial/geoapi/commit/8676b73d8d71218e8427f14b4551fee741752c9e">first commit
      of actual Java interfaces</a> was two months later.
      The <code>org.opengis</code> package name was used in agreement with the decision taken during above-cited ad-hoc meeting.
      While the interfaces were at first generated automatically from
      <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> defined in
      <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr>, they were progressively replaced by
      <a href="https://github.com/opengeospatial/geoapi/commit/056083c9fca20cadad4086e08593e8832a61da9b">hand-written
      interfaces using <abbr>OGC</abbr> 01-009 as a starting point</a>.
      Even if the <abbr title="Unified Modeling Language">UML</abbr>s were different,
      the design approach of <abbr title="Open Geospatial Consortium">OGC</abbr> 01-009 was still relevant.
      The mapping between the old model and the new model, and how both of them map to Java interfaces,
      is published in <a href="https://portal.ogc.org/files/?artifact_id=71648"><abbr>OGC</abbr> 09-083r4</a> annex F.
    </p>
    <h2>Formation of <abbr title="Geographic Objects">GO</abbr>-1 project</h2>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210731194144/https://www.ogc.org/pressroom/pressreleases/320"><abbr>OGC</abbr>
      issued a Request for Technology (<abbr>RFT</abbr>)</a> on September 6th, 2002
      (<a href="https://portal.ogc.org/files/?artifact_id=8578">anticipated during the summer</a>),
      slightly before open-source developers meet for the first time in above-cited <abbr>OGC</abbr> meetings.
      <!--
        New link, but date seems wrong:
        https://www.ogc.org/news/ogc-issues-a-request-for-technology-in-support-of-the-geographic-objects-initiative/
        RFT quote for search on internet:

           "The vision for the Geographic Objects Initiative is to define platform-independent and
            implementation-neutral interface models of specific geographic services or component objects."
      -->
      The <abbr title="Request for Technology">RFT</abbr> has been responded with the launch of
      <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220927212640/https://www.ogc.org/standards/go"><abbr title="Geographic Objects">GO</abbr>-1
      project</a> in January 2003, with goals very similar to GeoAPI. James McGill made a
      <a href="https://portal.ogc.org/files/?artifact_id=4492">call to work with open source projects</a> in January 2004.
      A joint GO-1/GeoAPI meeting was hold at <abbr>OGC</abbr> in <a href="https://portal.ogc.org/files/?artifact_id=6273">June 2004</a>
      and a <a href="https://portal.ogc.org/files/?artifact_id=6356">GeoAPI charter has been drafted</a>.
      The reported participants were:
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Projects:</b> <abbr>GO</abbr>-1, GeoTools, GeoServer, Geofoo,
            FreeGIS, SeaGIS, uDig, JUMP, Degree, OpenMap, Gnumeric, <abbr title="Java Topology Suite">JTS</abbr>.</li>
        <li><b>Organizations:</b> <abbr>BBN</abbr> Technologies, Refractions Research, <abbr>PCI</abbr> Geomatics,
            The Open Planning Project, Polexis, Penn State, lat/lon, Dominion t.i.,
            Institut de Recherche pour le Développement (<abbr>IRD</abbr>).</li>
      </ul>
    <p>
      <abbr title="Geographic Objects">GO</abbr>-1 working group officially started in September 2004.
      The project joined its effort with GeoAPI,
      but kept the <abbr title="Geographic Objects">GO</abbr>-1 name because it was the name used in the
      <abbr title="Request for Technology">RFT</abbr> before GeoAPI was launched.
      Version 1.0 of <abbr title="Geographic Objects">GO</abbr>-1 was completed in December 2004,
      published in May 2005 and accompanied by a
      <a href="https://www.geoapi.org/archives/2.0/index.html">formal GeoAPI 2.0.0 release</a> one month later.
    </p>

    <h2>GeoAPI/<abbr>GO</abbr>-1 activities</h2>
    <p>
      There is traces of <abbr title="Geographic Objects">GO</abbr>-1 and GeoAPI meetings in
      <a href="https://portal.ogc.org/files/?artifact_id=6930">October 2003</a>,
      <a href="https://portal.ogc.org/files/?artifact_id=5661">April 2004</a>,
      <a href="https://portal.ogc.org/files/?artifact_id=6222">June 2004</a>,
      <a href="https://portal.ogc.org/files/?artifact_id=7094">September 2004</a>,
      <a href="https://portal.ogc.org/files/?artifact_id=8817">January 2005</a> and
      <a href="https://portal.ogc.org/files/?artifact_id=13029">November 2005</a>.

      Different organizations contributed to different parts of GeoAPI.
      Before mid-May 2009, the project had
      about 700 commits from <abbr title="Institut de Recherche pour le développement">IRD</abbr> or Geomatys,
      about 400 commits from other GeoTools contributors,
      and about 150 commits from Polexis.
    </p><p>
      The <abbr title="Geographic Objects">GO</abbr>-1 project was largely supported by the <i>Polexis</i> company.
      Its acquisition by <i>Sys Technology</i> in March 2004, and the change in priorities under the new owners,
      brought a halt to the <abbr title="Geographic Objects">GO</abbr>-1 project,
      which in turn slowed development on GeoAPI.
      The GeoAPI working group has been dissolved in June 2006, but recreating the working group was
      <a href="https://portal.ogc.org/files/?artifact_id=103505">proposed one year later</a>
      and became <a href="https://portal.ogc.org/?m=projects&amp;a=view&amp;project_id=294">effective in January 2009</a> as GeoAPI 3.0.
      This group took a narrower focus compared to GeoAPI 2.0, concentrating on the most stable interfaces, and putting the others
      — such as geometries — in a module entitled “pending”, for future consideration.
      <a href="https://www.geoapi.org/3.0/index.html">GeoAPI 3.0</a> became an
      <a href="https://www.ogc.org/standard/geoapi/"><abbr>OGC</abbr> standard</a> in April 2011.
      This version was the first to be deployed in the <a href="https://central.sonatype.com/search?q=geoapi&amp;namespace=org.opengis">Maven central repository</a>.
      GeoAPI development continues since that time. From 2007 to 2022 they were
      <a href="https://portal.ogc.org/index.php?m=projects&amp;a=view&amp;project_id=294&amp;tab=2&amp;artifact_id=34498">more than 25
      <abbr title="Open Geospatial Consortium">OGC</abbr> meetings</a> with presentations or motions related to GeoAPI.
    </p>

    <h2>GeoTools fork</h2>
    <p>
      The most fervent GeoAPI supporters among GeoTools core developers were the ones who brought Seagis to GeoTools.
      They were the ones who attended most frequently to <abbr title="Open Geospatial Consortium">OGC</abbr> meetings.
      After those developers left the GeoTools project in May 2009, the GeoTools <abbr title="project management committee">PMC</abbr> decided to
      <a href="https://github.com/desruisseaux/GeoTools-archive/commit/a9926a2c8600044a036b778ccf19774708dc1489">fork GeoAPI 2.3-M1</a>
      (followed by a <a href="https://github.com/desruisseaux/GeoTools-archive/commit/5e4477fffc6015ae210bdaa97f7c898e79786e80">change
      of file headers</a>), but kept the <code>org.opengis</code> package name.
      The decision to continue to use the OpenGIS® namespace for GeoTools's fork of GeoAPI has
      <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-5399?focusedCommentId=17637991#comment-17637991">created
      conflicts with projects implementing the OGC GeoAPI 3.0 standard</a>.
      Some GeoTools users <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/geotools/mailman/message/33467346/">complained about this conflict</a>,
      but the GeoTools <abbr title="project management committee">PMC</abbr> replied — and
      <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210619072403/https://docs.geotools.org/stable/userguide/faq.html#q-relationship-with-geoapi">suggests
      in their <abbr title="Frequently Asked Questions">FAQ</abbr></a> —
      that GeoAPI was a GeoTools outreach project which donated their interfaces to <abbr>OGC</abbr>.
      To put this claim in perspective, the figure below is a timeline with the events cited in above paragraphs.
      Events related to GeoTools are in purple and italic characters.
      Events in blue characters occurred at <abbr title="Open Geospatial Consortium">OGC</abbr> or elsewhere.
      Green circles are <abbr title="Open Geospatial Consortium">OGC</abbr> meetings having some talks about GeoAPI
      or <abbr title="Geographic Objects">GO</abbr>-1.
    </p>
    <p class="figure">
      <img alt="Timeline" src="Timeline.png" width="1200">
    </p>
    <p>
      If "GeoAPI" is understood as Java interfaces in the <code>org.opengis</code> package namespace,
      or more generally as a common <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>
      for independent geospatial projects, then
      the GeoTools <abbr title="Frequently Asked Questions">FAQ</abbr> claim that GeoAPI started
      with GeoTools founder's email is false.
      The claim that <abbr title="Geographic Objects">GO</abbr>-1 started after GeoAPI ignores the prior
      <abbr title="Open Geospatial Consortium">OGC</abbr> <abbr title="Request for Technology">RFT</abbr>.
      The point saying that <abbr>OGC</abbr> GeoAPI working group has been dissolved omits to said that
      the group has been formally recreated three years later, and that <abbr>OGC</abbr> meetings did not stopped.
      The point saying that the <abbr>OGC</abbr> specification based on GeoAPI 2.0 has been retired
      omits to said that it has been replaced by <abbr>OGC</abbr> GeoAPI 3.0 standard,
      and that <abbr>OGC</abbr> has published formal GeoAPI releases on Maven Central.
    </p><p>
      GeoTools improved the honesty of their <abbr title="Frequently Asked Questions">FAQ</abbr> in March 2023
      and announced that work for resolving the package name collision would start in August.
      Those resolutions happened after the issue has been escalated to the OSGeo board
      with copy to <abbr title="Open Geospatial Consortium">OGC</abbr>.
      Disruption for GeoTools users could have been minimized by complying to the OGC standard for the metadata and referencing parts,
      since the <a href="https://www.geoapi.org/archives/2.3-M6/since-M1.html">changes between GeoTools fork and GeoAPI 3.0</a>
      were documented for ten years. But GeoTools decided to cut all links to <code>org.opengis</code>.
    </p>

    <h2>Continuation</h2>
    <p>
      GeoAPI 3.0 had two minor releases for following the evolution of Java environment:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>GeoAPI 3.0.1 was released by <abbr>OGC</abbr> in September 2017 for upgrading the JSR-275 dependency to JSR-363.</li>
      <li>GeoAPI 3.0.2 was released by <abbr>OGC</abbr> in February 2022 for upgrading the JSR-363 dependency to JSR-385
          and for introducing module information.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      As of February 2022, <abbr title="Open Geospatial Consortium">OGC</abbr> GeoAPI 3.0.2 is implemented by
      <a href="https://sis.apache.org/">Apache SIS</a>, implemented by <a href="https://github.com/OSGeo/PROJ-JNI">OSGeo PROJ-JNI</a>,
      and used by the <a href="https://github.com/IOGP-GIGS/GIGSGeoAPI">Geospatial Integrity of Geoscience Software (GIGS)</a> tests.
      Work for 3.1 or 4.0 release is in progress.
      A <a href="https://opengeospatial.github.io/ogcna-auto-review/23-016.html">specification draft</a> is publicly available.
      GeoAPI is among the most popular repositories of <a href="https://github.com/opengeospatial/"><abbr>OGC</abbr> GitHub</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several packages defined in GeoAPI 2.0 have been temporarily retired from GeoAPI 3.0 releases.
      The geometry package has been retired because two Ph.D. students tried independently
      to implement it with limited success, which suggests that the model needs revision
      (confirmed with new model in <abbr>ISO</abbr> 19107 revision).
      The coverage package has been retired because the model needs clarification
      (confirmed with new <cite>Coverage Implementation Schema</cite> part in <abbr>ISO</abbr> 19123 revision).
      The feature, filter and style packages have been retired because they were derived from <abbr>XML</abbr> schemas,
      which led to poor result for a programmatic <abbr>API</abbr>.
      The feature and filter packages are proposed for reintroduction in GeoAPI 3.1
      with a new <abbr>API</abbr> derived from <abbr>OGC</abbr>/<abbr>ISO</abbr> abstract models (<abbr>UML</abbr>).
      Other temporarily retired packages will follow later.
