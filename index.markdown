# Martin Desruisseaux home page

I hold a Ph.D in oceanography, but have continuously focused on developing tools for analysis work.
My programming experience was C/C++ before to switch to Java in 1997.
I develop geospatial libraries for more than 25 years,
as a contributor to Apache SIS since 2013.
I follow Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) meetings since 2002
in the hope to improve Apache SIS conformance to those standards.
I work in a small IT services company (Geomatys) specialized in development of geospatial software,
which uses Apache SIS as a foundation.

This page has been created has a place where to publish historical notes
about some projects in which I have been involved.
